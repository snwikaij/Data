# Data and supplementary information<br />
Welcome to my data repository! I hope this data can help you in satisfying your curiosities or strengthen your article(s). Below in the "read.me" each article is linked with its DOI to the online version of the Journal. The files are sorted in the repository by (1) the name of the Journal, (2) first author and (3) year of publication (Journal_Author_Year). The links/source  are ordered from oldest to newest, per year of publication. Every data source, if I am officially allowed to share, can be accessed via the "Link to Data". Equally, for the Supplementary material via "Link to Supplementary material". The data is in the .xlsx or .csv format, meaning it can be directly loaded into R for simplicity. For example, the csv to "Salinity tolerance of aquatic plants ..." can be loaded into R as:
```
read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snwikaij/Data/main/Aquatic_Botany_Kaijser_et_al._2019.csv"), header = T)
```

## Article link [Salinity tolerance of aquatic plants indicated by monitoring data from the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.103129)<br />
The data used in this article originates from a waterboard in the Netherlands. I never spend the effort to gather the information of this dataset, the link to the waterboard is https://scheldestromen.nl/. The people responsible for gathering the information are mentioned in the acknowledgement section.<br />

The data used in this article originates from multiple sources and sometimes it is not exactly clear which laboratory procedure and equipment were used to obtain the data. This is one of the dissadvantages of larger datasets from multiple sources, which need to be accepted and considered. Nonethless, even due to its coarseness, it contains valuable data with relative consistent patterns fitting with others. The sources are mentioned in the supplementary information.<br />

## Article link [Reach hydromorphology: a crucial environmental variable for the occurrence of riverine macrophytes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-022-04983-w)<br />
The data used in this article originates from multiple water managing authorities within the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany). Some unclear notations and naming in German is present.<br />

## Article link [Differential associations of five riverine organism groups with multiple stressors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724032522?via%3Dihub) <br />
The data used in this article originates from sampling designed within the RESIST-project. More variables are given in this dataset than used in the publication. Perhaps this might lend itself usefull for other analysisis. As I am only disclosed ot share what I used, therefore only the table used for the PCA and the similairity formated data for the different GLMMs are provided. Not the actuall raw data utilized in further studies. <br />
